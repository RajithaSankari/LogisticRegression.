# LogisticRegression.
## Project Title: Prediction of "Social_Network_Ads.csv" dataset to estimate the future prediction for "Age" vs "Estimated Salary".
## Problem Statement: A Indian news channel "Zee24" as predicted salary estimation for finanacial year 2018 ,2019.
## The organization wants to layoff the "salary" to be safe in a future by impacting huge loss.
## Task:
## As a Datascience proffesional select the particular algorithem and predict the futureistic esteemated salary.
